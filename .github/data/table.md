No `sshfs` cell is listed for any release: `fuse-sshfs` is not packaged in
Rocky's BaseOS or AppStream for 9 or 10 (it lives in EPEL), and a base image
should not carry a third-party repository. `rsync`, `nfs-utils` and `tree`
are all in BaseOS, so every other sync method listed above is real.

How the images are built:

Each image is built automatically in the
[anyvm-org/rockylinux-builder](https://github.com/anyvm-org/rockylinux-builder)
repo's GitHub Actions: it downloads the official Rocky Linux
GenericCloud image, customizes it (serial console, ssh, first-boot
setup), boots it in QEMU, pre-installs the packages listed in the conf,
and exports the disk as a compressed qcow2 image. No interactive
installer is run.

Upstream media: the official Rocky Linux cloud images from
https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/ (download page:
https://rockylinux.org/download).
